## ArraySet

This is an OS X command-line application that was originally created to experiment
with an Array->Set->Array minialgorithm, but morphed into a more general testbed for
Swift performance.

This is for the folks who are stuck in my "Swift Performance" talk at CocoaConf DC
and have no chance for escape.
